## `MANIFEST` syntax

- `~/bin/destination_link: ./section/source_file`
  - destination-to-source mapping, with the two arguments delimited by a colon

- `$ bin`
  - defines the `bin` section

- `/bin/sh: @delete`
  deletes /bin/sh

- `@include: bin default`
   - includes `bin` and `default`
   - in each run of `manifest.py` includes are resolved recursively so that they are only processed once
